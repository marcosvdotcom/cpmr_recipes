Most site pages can be edited by navigating to the sites pages folder, which stores the markdown files that hold page content. 
You can click Edit in the top right corner and then edit the file. The file sare written in markdown and can also handle html (though excessive html coding should be avoided when markdown solutiosn are aviabale).
Once satisfied click commit changes.
You may need to hard refresh to see the updates pull throuh on the demo site.

5) Nav links are created via the config-nav.csv in teh _data folder. This can also be edited in github by editing config-nav.csv. This should only be down when in the infrequent case where we are adding a new page.
