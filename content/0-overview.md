#Overveiw and Tools List

This micosite was created to host instructions and tutorials on how to use and maintain the CPMR CollectionBuilder based website.

## URL's

The live website at www.chicanapormiraza.org is connected to this repository:
marcothevandal

For security, changes to the live site need to be manually review by Marco to be deplyed. He will receive a notification when you work on the development site. You can incldue in your commit notes, or email him at marcosv@uidaho.edu, to request changes be pushed through to the live site.

marcosvdotcom.github.io/chicanapormiraza is our development space. Changes that make following these directions will upload to this url and can be viewed live.

## Basics

Our site is written using markdown. You can learn more about markdown here.

This page, which shows various built in Collection Builder features examples of what you can do. 

## Tools needed

To get started you will need:

Required tools:

- github account, sign up for free at github.com
- visit [text](repo_url) and click to be added as a user. this step is necessary to contribute to the github repository and see your changes live on marcosvdotcom.github.io/chicanapormiraza
- free plaintext editor (Sublime or Visual Studio Code recommended)

Advanced tools:

- github desktop, free desktop client that connects files on your local computer to your reposittory 

Super advance:

- command line dependencies to support local development, read more at [Collection Builder]().


Most users will just need the required tools section to perform basic site updates, edits, and new content creation. Github Desktop creates a local version of your github repository (think how google drive can sync your content), that you can then keep synced with the marcosvdotcom repository via "pusing" and "pulling" requests. This step is recommended if you're intending to go onto the supser advanced local environment deploymnet, but is also handy if you're editing a lot of files and/or just prefer to use your text editor versus the inbrowser editor.

Super advanced allows you to create a locally hosted version of the website to experiment and test with. This removees any potential lag caused by uploading to hte github servers.

There are some one time dependency requirements which you will need to isntall. You can read more about those here [cb link](cb link)

I suggest trying it out with a black version of CollectionBuilder first, to make sure you have all the depenceices you need. Once you hvae that working, navigate to the chicanapormiraza repositry and click open in github desktop. Then nvaivte to that folder in your terminal and type jekyll s. If all is godo with the dpenences the site shoudl spool up at a local url that looks like this:
